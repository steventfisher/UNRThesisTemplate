\chapter{Proof of the SSL (Stupid Silly Lemma)}
Don't you just love writing proofs? Maybe this proof requires an algorithm. Lets take a look at an algorithm. Clearly there are some formatting issues in the algorithm/algorithmic environment. I'm still working on fixing these issues...


\begin{algorithm}
    \label{euclid}
    \caption{Euclidâ€™s algorithm}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \Procedure{Euclid}{$a,b$}\Comment{The g.c.d. of a and b}
            \State $r\gets a\bmod b$
            \While{$r\not=0$}\Comment{We have the answer if r is 0}
            \State $a\gets b$
            \State $b\gets r$
            \State $r\gets a\bmod b$
            \EndWhile\label{euclidendwhile}
            \State \textbf{return} $b$\Comment{The gcd is b}
            \EndProcedure
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
